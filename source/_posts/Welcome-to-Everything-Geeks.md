This is my first post on this blog, which I hope will be part of a long series of articles.

I wanted to open this blog to talk about little things on a regular basis. This can be little programming tips, maybe cool hardware stuff that's coming in the next few months/years, and various other subjects, some which may not even be related to computer science at all. We'll see!

I'll try to commit posting on this blog regularily, but I don't know for how long I'll have the motivation to write here, so let's see this site as a little "experiment".

I'm writing this blog in [markdown]() using [Hexo](https://hexo.io/) and [Fluid](https://github.com/fluid-dev/hexo-theme-fluid). Whenever I write an article, I simply create a markdown file, write stuff inside, and push it with a simple `git push` to the [blog's  repository](https://github.com/ClementNerma/EverythingGeeks), which then automatically deploys itself to [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

Oh, by the way, I realize I didn't introduce myself. So, let's go.

My name is ClÃ©ment Nerma. "ClÃ©ment" is my real first name, but "Nerma" is actually a pseudonym that comes from the name of a dragon I imagined when I was a child (yes, that's the first idea that came to my mind when I created this name).

I currently live and work in France as a backend web developer. I mainly make websites using Nest.js and TypeORM/MikroORM, as well as a bit of front sometimes with React.js. All in TypeScript (of course!).

But besides of my work, I love studying low-level programming and how computers actually work. How an operating system balances performances between processes, how programs communicate efficiently but in a still "perfecly" (almost) secure way, etc.

If you want to check my active projects, I'm currently working on an operating system called [NightOS](https://github.com/ClementNerma/NightOS) which aims to be a theorically-viable solution to modern operating systems, by getting rid of many problems existing deep inside of today's OSes because of compatibility with legacy software. I also work on a tiny [virtual machine runtime in Rust](https://github.com/ClementNerma/MRVM) to experiment a bit with the language and performances tweaking.

Well, I think I've said everything, so let's see how this blog grows (if it does) and what it becomes in the next weeks.

See you soon ðŸ˜‰!
