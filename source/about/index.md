Hello there, welcome to my blog!

My name is ClÃ©ment Nerma, and I'm a professional web developer. I currently live in France.

I opened this blog to talk about... stuff. I don't have a precise idea of what this blog will be, which is why the blog's title is pretty vague itself.

Anyway, welcome aboard ðŸ™‚!

Oh and, by the way, this blog is fully open-source and you can find its source code [on github](https://github.com/ClementNerma/EverythingGeeks) ðŸ˜‰

Also, a huge thanks to [@rmRadev](https://www.deviantart.com/rmradev) for kindly allowing me to use their art for the background image of this blog <3
