    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is my first post on this blog, which I hope will be part of a long series of articles.</p><p>I wanted to open this blog to talk about little things on a regular basis. This can be little programming tips, maybe cool hardware stuff that’s coming in the next few months/years, and various other subjects.</p><p>I’ll try to commit posting on this blog regularily, but I don’t know for how long I’ll have the motivation to write here, so let’s see this site as a little “experiment”.</p><p>I’m writing this blog in <a href="">markdown</a> using <a href="https://hexo.io/">Hexo</a> and <a href="https://github.com/fluid-dev/hexo-theme-fluid">Fluid</a>. Whenever I write an article, I simply create a markdown file, write stuff inside, and push it with a simple <code>git push</code> to the <a href="https://github.com/ClementNerma/EverythingGeeks">blog’s  repository</a>, which then automatically deploys itself to <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub pages</a> using <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a>.</p><p>Oh, by the way, I realize I didn’t introduce myself. So, let’s go.</p><p>My name is Clément Nerma. “Clément” is my real first name, but “Nerma” is actually a pseudonym that comes from the name of a dragon I imagined when I was a child (yes, that’s the first idea that came to my mind when I created this name).</p><p>I currently live and work in France as a backend web developer. I mainly make websites using Nest.js and TypeORM/MikroORM, as well as a bit of front sometimes with React.js. All in TypeScript (of course!).</p><p>But besides of my work, I love studying low-level programming and how computers actually work. How an operating system balances performances between processes, how programs communicate efficiently but in a still “perfecly” (almost) secure way, etc.</p><p>If you want to check my active projects, I’m currently working on an operating system called <a href="https://github.com/ClementNerma/NightOS">NightOS</a> which aims to be a theorically-viable solution to modern operating systems, by getting rid of many problems existing deep inside of today’s OSes because of compatibility with legacy software. I also work on a tiny <a href="https://github.com/ClementNerma/MRVM">virtual machine runtime in Rust</a> to experiment a bit with the language and performances tweaking.</p><p>Well, I think I’ve said everything, so let’s see how this blog grows (if it does) and what it becomes in the next weeks.</p><p>See you soon 😉!</p>]]></content>
